    <p>I am an interaction design perfectionist specializing in user interfaces for web, mobile and touch based devices. My background is in web where I believe a great user experience comes from the user-centered design philosophy. I enjoy bridging the gap between code and design, usually in the browser via the latest HTML standards and CSS preprocessors such as LESS and SASS/SCSS.</p>
